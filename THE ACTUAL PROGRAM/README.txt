COOL TID BITS, info & top tips

if you have patterns in an FLP named after difficulties ("easy", "normal", "hard", probably case sensitive idr lol) it will automatically let u export multiple at once
you can also select multiple files it'll do em all.
bf/opponent notes are exactly an octave apart. ctrl+up/down to eazy swap between them
if a note is 2 steps long or longer, it will automatically be a held note. if you want the note to be held for any shorter than that, set the velocity to 50% or lower.
you can only use CAM, ALT AN and BPM CH triggers once per bar (4 beats).
if you want a note to individually have an alt animation (like in Ugh), you can double click it and check the "Porta" checkbox
if you GROUP notes, they might not export so be careful with that
it's probably best to pad out the end of the song with an unassigned note (i prefer B3) if there's still audio playing, so it generates some empty sections
